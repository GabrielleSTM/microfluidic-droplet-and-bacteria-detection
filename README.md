# microfluidic-droplet-and-bacteria-detection
Real-time microfluidic droplet and bacteria detection pipeline developed during my engineering internship at ICube, within the IRUPP project (Iron Uptake Pathways in Pseudomonas aeruginosa). This repository provides a high-level overview of the methodology, models, preprocessing strategies, and results, without exposing confidential code or data.
